      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a Data Engineer with 2+ years of experience, I specialize in designing, optimizing, and automating large-scale data pipelines that power data-driven decision-making for global clients across APAC and the US. I bring expertise in Snowflake, Power BI, Google Looker, AWS Glue, Google Data Fusion, and Azure Data Factory, backed by strong skills in SQL, Python, and cloud-based ETL automation.

        At HCL Technologies, I have successfully delivered high-performance, cost-efficient, and scalable data solutions for clients such as Procter & Gamble, Kalsec, and Bausch & Lomb. My contributions include architecting Snowflake data models, enhancing dashboard performance through SQL/DAX optimization, and building cloud-native ETL workflows that reduced manual interventions by up to 60%.
        
        I am passionate about transforming raw datasets into actionable business insights through robust data models, interactive dashboards, and real-time analytics. Recognized for process automation and performance optimization, I thrive in cross-functional teams and ensure that data architectures meet the highest standards of governance, security, and scalability.
        
        Certified in AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate, I continue to advance my expertise in multi-cloud environments to help businesses harness the full potential of their data.</p>
